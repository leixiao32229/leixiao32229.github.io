      <description>Welcome to my site! I am a fourth-year PhD student of Operations Research at Columbia University. I&amp;rsquo;m fortunate to be advised by Prof. Adam Elmachtoub. I&amp;rsquo;m joining HKU Business School as an assistant professor in the fall. My research spans two major themes:
 Operations management in emerging digital markets, with a current focus on video games. Promoting responsible operations in profit-driven businesses.  In the summer of 2020, I worked as a data scientist intern at Activision Blizzard.</description>
